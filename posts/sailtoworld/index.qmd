Every semester, SMP will orginaize students sharing session, with the help of DA, we successfully invited some of honor students to share their university life.

More than 200 students in SMP participate in the sharing session, I am delighted to see so many SMP students successfully applying to top-tier universities' graduate programs worldwide. Among the numerous postgraduate programs, we also help students discern whether they are worth pursuing. It's great to see everyone having their own ideas, persevering in walking their own paths, and becoming global citizens.
